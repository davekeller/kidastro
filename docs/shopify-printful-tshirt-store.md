# Shopify + Printful T-Shirt Store Plan

A print-on-demand t-shirt business using Shopify for the storefront and Printful for fulfillment.

## Overview

- **Business Model**: Print-on-demand (no inventory)
- **Storefront**: Shopify
- **Fulfillment**: Printful (prints, packs, ships directly to customers)
- **Risk**: Low - only pay for products when orders come in

## Setup Steps

### 1. Shopify Store

- Sign up at [shopify.com](https://shopify.com)
- Plans start at ~$39/month (Basic plan)
- Choose a theme and customize branding
- Set up payment processing (Shopify Payments or Stripe)
- Configure shipping zones (Printful handles actual shipping)

### 2. Printful Integration

- Install the [Printful app](https://apps.shopify.com/printful) from Shopify App Store
- Free to install - you pay per order when items sell
- Connect Printful account to Shopify
- Products sync automatically between platforms

### 3. Create Products

- Design t-shirt graphics (PNG or vector files)
- In Printful's mockup generator:
  - Choose shirt styles (cotton, tri-blend, etc.)
  - Select available colors
  - Set sizes (S-3XL, etc.)
  - Position artwork (front, back, sleeve)
- Generate product mockups automatically
- Push products to Shopify with one click

### 4. Order Flow

1. Customer places order on Shopify store
2. Printful automatically receives order details
3. Printful prints the design on the shirt
4. Printful packs and ships directly to customer
5. You keep the margin (your price - Printful cost)

## Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Shopify Basic | $39/month |
| Printful t-shirt (base) | ~$10-15 per shirt |
| Printful shipping (US) | ~$4-8 |
| Your retail price | You decide (e.g., $25-35) |

**Example margin**: Sell shirt for $28, Printful cost ~$13 = ~$15 profit per sale

## Printful Product Options

- **T-shirts**: Bella+Canvas, Gildan, Next Level, etc.
- **Hoodies**: Pullover, zip-up
- **Tank tops**
- **Long sleeves**
- **All-over prints** (higher cost, more unique)

## Design Requirements

- **File format**: PNG (transparent background) or vector (AI, SVG)
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI minimum
- **Dimensions**: Varies by print area (Printful provides templates)
- **Color mode**: RGB for digital printing

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Design 3-5 initial t-shirt graphics
- [ ] Choose Shopify theme (minimal/modern recommended)
- [ ] Set up brand identity (logo, colors, tone)
- [ ] Configure email marketing (Klaviyo integrates well)
- [ ] Plan social media presence for marketing
- [ ] Consider Printful's warehousing for faster shipping (optional)
